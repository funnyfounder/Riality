        <h3>We Made 9kg of Paper from $1</h3>
        <p>One dollar. 9000 notes. 9 kilograms of shredded pulp. Here's how we turned memes into material gains.</p>
        <p>It all started with hyperinflation in Iran where 1 USD could net 9000 worthless bills. The idea? Recycle it, sell it, and laugh on the way to the pulp bank. It may seem absurd, but paper recycling mills pay around $1.20 per kg. That turns a dollar into $10.80 – and after cost, pure satire-fueled profit.</p>
        <p>Now imagine a whole warehouse of this stuff. That's not just a meme — that's a business model (or a cautionary tale). Either way, we’re printing something with value... even if it’s toilet paper.</p>

        <h3>Future of Trash Cash</h3>
        <p>From AI to NFTs to industrial-grade pulp – RIALITY isn’t just about jokes. It’s about potential, commentary, and converting financial tragedy into comedy gold.</p>
        <p>We dream of scaling. Collection stations for defunct currency. Pulping vans on the streets. Airdropping coupons. Collaborating with art students. Launching the world's first satirical stock index. Our future is weird — and it’s profitable in spirit (and maybe more).</p>
        <p>Stay tuned. We’re just getting started.</p>
